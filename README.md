Hello, my name is James Bedford.

I enjoy coding bioinformatics problems from the website Rosalind along with other random projects.

I typically work with Python for bioinformatics along with a sprinkling of C#.
More recently I've been working on web development with Vue.

Feel free to have a look through my random assortment of code.

A small webapp I created with Vue to help learn Japanese words can be found hosted on Firebase at <nihongo-words-31664.web.app>
