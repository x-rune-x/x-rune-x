Hello, my name is James Bedford.

I enjoy coding bioinformatics problems from the website Rosalind along with other random projects.

I currently work as a research assistant where I study immunology but am hoping to transition into the tech industry.

I typically work with Python but have some knowledge of Java, JavaScript and HTML.
I've recently started getting into C#.

Please feel free to have a look through my random assortment of code.
