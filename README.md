Hello, my name is James Bedford.

I enjoy coding bioinformatics problems from the website Rosalind along with other random projects.

I typically work with Python but have some knowledge of Java, JavaScript and HTML.
I've recently started getting into C#.

Feel free to have a look through my random assortment of code.
