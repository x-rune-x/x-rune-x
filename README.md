Hello, my name is James Bedford.

I enjoy coding bioinformatics problems from the website Rosalind along with other random projects.

I currently work as a research assistant where I study immunology but am hoping to transition into tech business.

I typically work with Python but have some knowledge of Java, JavaScript and HTML.
