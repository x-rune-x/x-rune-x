Hello, my name is James Bedford.

I enjoy coding bioinformatics problems from the website Rosalind along with other random projects.

I typically work with Python for bionformatics along with a sprinkling of C#.
More recently I've been working on web development using Java Script and HTML with Vue.

Feel free to have a look through my random assortment of code.
